    </p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li> ¾ cups flour plus extra for dusting</li>
    <li> ⅓ cup shortening</li>
    <li> ½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li> ¾ cup milk</li>
    <li> ½ teaspoon salt</li>


    <li> 4 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
    <li> parsley for garnish</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Combine chicken, onion, carrots and celery in a large pot. Season to taste.</li>
    <li>Add chicken broth. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer covered 45-60 minutes or until chicken is tender. While broth is simmering, prepare dumplings below.</li>
    <li>Remove chicken and vegetables from broth. Discard skin and bones and chop remaining chicken, set aside.</li>
    <li>Gently add dumplings to broth. Simmer 15-20 minutes or until tender.</li>
    <li>Stir chicken (and vegetables if desired) into broth and cook about 2-3 minutes or until heated through.</li>

    <li>In a small bowl combine 4 tablespoons cornstarch with 4 tablespoons water.</li>
    <li>Add to boiling broth a little bit at a time stirring to reach desired consistency.</li>

    <li>Combine flour, baking powder, salt and shortening with a fork until shortening is mixed in.</li>
    <li>Add milk a little at a time and mix until combined (you may not need all of it, you want a soft but not sticky dough).</li>
    <li>Knead a few times on a floured surface until dough is smooth.</li>
    <li>Generously flour your surface and roll the dough out to ⅛″ thick. Cut dough into 1″ x 2″ strips. Flour generously to avoid sticking.</li>
    <li>Cook in broth as directed above.</li>
</ol>
